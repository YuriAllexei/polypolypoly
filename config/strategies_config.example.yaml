# Sniper Strategies Configuration
# This config is used by the sniper binary

# Log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace
log_level: "info"

# Up or Down strategy settings
up_or_down:
  # Time window in seconds before market ends to trigger alert
  delta_t_seconds: 300
  # How often to poll database for new markets (seconds)
  poll_interval_secs: 60
  # Minimum price difference in basis points between oracle and market for trade signal
  oracle_bps_price_threshold: 50.0

  # Dynamic threshold parameters (exponential decay based on time to market end)
  # Formula: threshold = min + (max - min) * (1 - exp(-time_remaining / tau))
  # Minimum threshold in seconds (when close to market end - more aggressive)
  threshold_min: 0.5
  # Maximum threshold in seconds (when far from market end - more conservative)
  threshold_max: 10.0
  # Decay time constant in seconds (controls how fast threshold decreases)
  threshold_tau: 30.0

# Sports Sniping strategy settings
sports_sniping:
  # How often to poll for updates (seconds)
  poll_interval_secs: 1.0
  # Enable/disable the strategy
