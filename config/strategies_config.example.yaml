# Sniper Strategies Configuration
# This config is used by the sniper binary

# Log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace
log_level: "info"

# Component settings (shared infrastructure)
components:
  balance_manager:
    # Halt threshold as fraction (0.10 = halt if balance drops below 10% of peak)
    threshold: 0.10

# Up or Down strategy settings
up_or_down:
  # Time window in seconds before market ends to trigger alert
  delta_t_seconds: 700
  # Fraction of collateral to use per order (e.g., 0.10 = 10%)
  order_pct_of_collateral: 0.10
  # How often to poll database for new markets (seconds)
  poll_interval_secs: 0.2
  # Minimum price difference in basis points between oracle and market for trade signal
  # (bypassable in final 5 seconds)
  oracle_bps_price_threshold: 100.0
  # Guardian safety threshold in basis points - cancels orders if oracle is within this
  # distance of price_to_beat. Never bypassed, runs until market timer ends.
  guardian_safety_bps: 2.0

  # Dynamic threshold parameters (exponential decay based on time to market end)
  # Formula: threshold = min + (max - min) * (1 - exp(-time_remaining / tau))
  # Minimum threshold in seconds (when close to market end - more aggressive)
  threshold_min: 0.1
  # Maximum threshold in seconds (when far from market end - more conservative)
  threshold_max: 10.0
  # Decay time constant in seconds (controls how fast threshold decreases)
  threshold_tau: 15.0

# Sports Sniping strategy settings
sports_sniping:
  # How often to poll for updates (seconds)
  poll_interval_secs: 1.0
  # Enable/disable the strategy
